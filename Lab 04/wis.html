				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Sending and receiving text messages has become part of our daily activities. Can you imagine
					yourselves
					without a mobile phone for a day? Would you leave home without it? And would you be wondering how
					those mobile
					applications are written, were you can send a text message to a specified number, and you get the
					necessary
					information needed in a form of a reply, or simply registering your name for a contest?</p>
				<p>This article discusses the things you need to know in order to program your own wireless information
					service.
					In validating the concept, a sample program was created using Sun Microsystems's Java[tm] 2 Standard
					Edition
					(J2SE[tm]) and Java Communication API. The application developed had been tested on a PC equipped
					with an
					infrared dongle that connects to an infrared enabled phone, in this case a Nokia 8310. The
					application is
					divided into two parts, the messaging library and the information service application.</p>

				<h3>Understanding the SMS Message</h3>
				<p>Before developing the application, let us take a look at how a message is handled by the mobile
					phone. A
					Short Messaging Service or SMS text can be up to 160 characters long. Each character of the message
					is
					represented using 7 bits instead of 8. 8-bit messages with a maximum of 140 characters are usually
					not
					viewable as text messages. This is normally used for ringtones and images. Unicode (UCS2) text
					messages, which
					are used for Asian languages, are 16-bit messages. This type of messages has a maximum length of 70
					characters. Blinking SMS is also represented as a 16-bit message otherwise known as Flash SMS.</p>
